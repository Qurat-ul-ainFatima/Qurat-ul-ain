Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The game selects a random word, and your goal is to guess it one letter at a time. But be carefulâ€”you only have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game is over.

How to Play
Start the Game: When you run the game, it will select a random word from a predefined list. The length of the word will be shown as underscores (_), with each underscore representing a letter in the word.

Make a Guess: You'll be prompted to guess a letter. Enter any letter you think might be in the word.

Correct Guess: If the letter you guessed is in the word, all instances of that letter will be revealed in their correct positions.

Incorrect Guess: If the letter is not in the word, you'll lose one of your allowed incorrect guesses. You have up to 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

Win or Lose:

Win: If you guess all the letters in the word before running out of incorrect guesses, you win!
Lose: If you use up all your incorrect guesses without uncovering the entire word, the game ends, and you'll be shown the word you were trying to guess.

Example Gameplay:
